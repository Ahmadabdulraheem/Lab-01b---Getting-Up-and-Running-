      <h1>PICK FOR YOUR TRIP ANYTIME!</h1>
      <p>Think you’re too busy to get away from work? You might be surprised to find that going on vacation – whether a weekend getaway or a weeks-long break – is exactly what the doctor ordered.

        Scientific research has discovered what many of us intuitively know – what we really need is some time away from the workplace, wherever in the world we call home. What is it about going “on holiday” that boosts our well-being, relieves stress and helps us live fuller lives?
        
        “We are energy machines. We have to replenish the energy we expend,” says Joe Robinson, the Santa Monica, California-based author of Work to Live and a work/life balance and productivity speaker and trainer. “We crave them psychologically because our brain neurons want two things more than anything else for long-term fulfillment: novelty and challenge. Vacations provide both in spades.”
        
        And studies show they’re good for what (potentially may) ail us. Consider this: the long-running Framingham Heart Study from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Boston University found that men who didn’t take vacation for several years were 30 percent more likely to have heart attacks than those who did. The University of Pittsburgh’s Mind-Body Center surveyed nearly 1,400 people and discovered that leisure pursuits – which include vacations – “contributed to higher positive emotional levels and less depression,” not to mention lower blood pressure and smaller waistlines.
        
        Researchers even have found that the anticipation of a getaway can be more satisfying than remembering it once you get home. Psychology and neuroscience Professor Dr. Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Marketing Professor Dr. Laurence Ashworth of Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, found that because future events are less certain than those in the past, merely looking forward to vacations “may be more arousing than retrospection about those events.”
